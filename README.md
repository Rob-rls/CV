# Robert Summers

I am a former insurance professional who has worked in the US, Australia and the UK.  In my previous career, I found that the tasks I enjoyed most allowed me to use my creativity, problem-solving skills, and work on project teams.  This lead me to rediscover a passion for code from my childhood where I used to make little text adventure games in BASIC on an Apple IIe.

I have recently learned web development at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), an intensive 16-week bootcamp where the focus was on instilling the values of clean code and software craftsmanship.

## Skills

#### Teamwork

I have over 10 years of professional work within teams.  I understand that no task is too small and to value input from the group.
  * At Makers, we frequently broke off into teams where we had to design and develop software projects.
  * When I worked at Axis Capital, I was frequently pulled in to project teams were I communicated the specification and provided feedback to the developers.

#### Fast learner
I enjoy learning and am not afraid to try new technologies.
* Without any prior knowledge of the platform or technologies used, I (with my team) crated an Android app using Java in less than 2 weeks.  You can view the code [here](https://github.com/Rob-rls/PlatformerRun)
* While working in insurance, I keep up with my education and sat for professional exams with the CII (Chartered Insurance Institute).

## Experience

My non developer life is all documented on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-summers-5213578b).  Some recent highlights are below.

#### Senior Operations Technician - Axis Capital, London (2014 - 2016)
  * I was the senior member of the operations team.  My biggest accomplishment was being a product owner where I was able to work on the entire development cycle for a piece of software.  I had to provide input for the speciation and continual feedback to the development team throughout the process.  The product launched and returned valuable MI on the day-to-day production of the department.

#### Senior Account Technician - Allianz, Sydney (2013 - 2014)
  * I was transferred to Sydney to help upscale the local team's global insurance capabilities.  There, I worked very closely with local brokers for whom I designed and lead a workshop on global insurance programs.
