# Robert Summers

I am a former insurance professional and am excited to start a career as a developer.  In my past role, I found that the tasks I enjoyed most allowed me to use my creativity, problem-solving skills, and work on project teams.  This lead me to rediscover a passion for code from my childhood where I used to make little text adventure games in BASIC on an Apple IIe.

As a graduate of [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), an intensive 16-week bootcamp where the focus was on instilling the values of clean code and software craftsmanship, I look forward to joining a company that the I can make a significant contribution to as well as empower me to continue in my professional development.  

## Skills

#### Teamwork

I have over 10 years of professional work within teams as well as a student at Makers.  I understand that no task is to small and to value input from the group.
  * At Makers, we frequently broke off into teams where we had design and develop software projects.
  * When I worked at Axis Capital, I was frequently pulled in to project teams were I needed to communicate the specification and provide feedback to the developers.

#### Fast learner
I enjoy learning and am not afraid to try new technologies.
* Without any prior knowledge of the platform or technologies used, I (with my team) crated an Android app using Java.
* While working in insurance, I keep up with my education and sat for professional exams with the CII.
